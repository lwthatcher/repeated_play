## Report:
 - [ ] describe and justify your strategy (1 pg)
 - [ ] description of the results for each number of trials listed above (5, 100, and 200); 
 - [ ] description of the results for each of the probabilities above (0.75, 0.9, and 0.99); 
 - [ ] explanation of why the winner won, and discussing how their strategy performed and why (1 pg)

## Experiments:
|   | 5 trials | 100 trials | 200 trials |
|---|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| **p = 1.0**| :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| **p = 0.99**| :white_large_square: | :white_large_square: | :white_large_square: |
| **p = 0.9**| :white_large_square: | :white_large_square: | :white_large_square: |
| **p = 0.75**| :white_large_square: | :white_large_square: | :white_large_square: |
  
  > **Note:** do several (maybe 5?) trials for each, record mean/var
  
*Each agent will compete against all other agents, and the total scores will be recorded.*
